    </header>

    <p>I am a web developer and scrum master working in the financial &amp; automotive sector.</p>
<p>While I work very &lsquo;full-stack&rsquo;, my real love is frontend.
Especially frontend frameworks / libraries as they increase overall development speed and brand conformity. I will always defend and fight for them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fairly experienced when it comes to <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and I actually love <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a reader, through-and-through. It&rsquo;s in my blood - I didn&rsquo;t know that it was possible for parents not to always have a book around until fairly recently.
It shocked me, I always thought that it was a normal parent thing - like awful dad jokes, it just came with having kids.</p>
<p>My upcoming project plans include:</p>
<ul>
<li>100 years of reading</li>
<li>books for the lonely island overview</li>
<li>summary of all books mentioned on the WSIRN podcast</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell me about your favorite books, I&rsquo;m always looking for new reading material!</p>
