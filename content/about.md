I am a web developer and scrum master working in the financial & automotive sector.

While I work very 'full-stack', my real love is frontend.
Especially frontend frameworks / libraries as they increase overall development speed and brand conformity. I will always defend and fight for them.

I'm fairly experienced when it comes to [React](https://reactjs.org/) and I actually love [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Books

I'm a reader, through-and-through. It's in my blood - I didn't know that it was possible for parents not to always have a book around until fairly recently.
It shocked me, I always thought that it was a normal parent thing - like awful dad jokes, it just came with having kids.

My upcoming project plans include:

- 100 years of reading
- books for the lonely island overview
- summary of all books mentioned on the WSIRN podcast

Tell me about your favorite books, I'm always looking for new reading material!
